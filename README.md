My Personal Website in progress...

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which I am developing to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. I am using modern technologies such as JavaScript and React to build an interactive, responsive, and elegantly designed application.

Technologies Used
• JavaScript: The main language for logic and interactivity.
• React: A library for building dynamic and modular interfaces.
• CSS: Styling to create an attractive and responsive design.

Project Objectives
• Create an online portfolio to showcase past projects.
• Enhance my skills in front-end development.
• Explore advanced React concepts, including hooks, state management, and functional components.

Planned Features
• A homepage with animations and visual effects.
• An “About Me” section with professional information.
• A dynamic project listing with links to repositories.
• A functional contact form.
